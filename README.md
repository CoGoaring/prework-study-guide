# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a website housing all the notes a student could need for the individual topics we covered in our prework. 
This includes notes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This solves the issue of not having a good place for all of our notes, while also giving me good practice for skills I will need.
